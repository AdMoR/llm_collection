      "Wait, in the example, they specifically mentioned trying to adapt already famous jokes, so maybe the prompt should mention that, for instance, it's okay to take the structure of a classic pun or wordplay and apply it to the chosen animals. Also, perhaps the prompt should guide the user to choose animals that are known for certain behaviors or characteristics that can be easily lampooned or conflated with other things.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what a binary tree with exactly k leaves looks like. Since each node has two children, the structure of the tree is determined by how many leaves it has. For example, a single node is a leaf itself, so that's one leaf. If it has two children, each of those can be leaves, making it a tree with three nodes and three leaves. Wait, no—if the root has two leaves as children, then that's a tree with three nodes and three leaves, right? Or is that incorrect?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me clarify. A leaf node is a node with no children. So, if the root has two children, each of those can be leaves or not. So, the number of leaves depends on how many nodes have no children. If the root has two leaves, then the tree has three nodes and three leaves. If the root's children each have their own children, then we get more leaves. So, the number of leaves can vary based on the structure.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, for a given number of leaves, k, how many nodes are there? Well, in a binary tree, each non-leaf node has two children. So, the number of internal nodes can be calculated. Wait, maybe it's similar to the concept of binary trees and their properties.\n",

      "Let me think about it differently. In a binary tree, the number of leaves is related to the number of internal nodes.

      "Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the number of nodes in a binary tree given the number of leaves. Let me see. For a full binary tree, which is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children, the number of nodes can be expressed in terms of the number of leaves.\n",

      "\n",

So, that doesn't hold.\n",
